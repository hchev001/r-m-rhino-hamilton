# Red Rhino Technical Assessment
Objective of this technical assessment is to develop a Frontend Application that consumes a RESTful API of the Rick & Morty show.

# Live Demo
It is hosted on a digital ocean droplet at the following dummy url [challengewf.life](https://challengewf.life/)

## Setup
Install NodeJS on your system, this project was developed using NodeJS version 14.0.0. Thus using the latest LTS of NodeJS 14.X.Y should work. Else see alternate link to download version 14.0.0

[NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.0.0/)

[NodeJS 14.0.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.0.0/)

Unless downloading the code directly via HTTPS, your system will also need Git in order to clone the project.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Assuming you are working from the terminal, 
clone my project in the directory of personal preference.

`git clone https://github.com/hchev001/r-m-rhino-hamilton.git`

Open the directory of the cloned project and install the project dependencies by running.

`npm install`

Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can start the project locally by entering `npm start` from the command line.

## Reflection

Did I have fun building this project? Definitly, decided I'd use the project to learn Tailwind CSS and I'm sold on it. I don't think I will be going back to styled-components, or sparingly.
